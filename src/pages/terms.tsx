                Parity Technologies Limited (&quot;Parity&quot;) is a company registered in England and Wales under
                company number 09760015 with its registered office at c/o Ignition Law, 1 Sans Walk, London, England,
                EC1R 0LT. We operate the website parity.io, paritytech.io, polkadot.io and any subdomains such as
                sub0.parity.io (the &quot;Sites&quot;).

              <p className="font-semibold">Understanding these Terms of Use</p>
              <p>
                These terms of use (together with the documents referred to in it) (the “Terms”) describe how you may
                access, browse, use and interact with the Sites. By using the Sites you confirm that you accept these
                Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms, you must
                not use the Sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific meanings (these are known as
                &quot;defined terms&quot;). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters
                (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning
                given to it in the section of these Terms where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking
                at the sentence where the defined term is included in speech marks).
              </p>
              <p>
                In these Terms, when we refer to &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;, we mean Parity, and
                when we refer to &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; we mean the person accessing or using the Sites.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                We reserve the right to refuse or accept, remove or refuse or cease to use any User Generated Content
                supplied by any person that we think contravenes these standards. We also have the right to disclose

              </p>
              <p>
                You acknowledge, understand and agree that other users of the Sites may upload or supply their own User
                Generated Content on the Sites (in particular, though without limitation, users who submit pallets and
                tools to be made available on the Marketplace sub-domain). We are under no obligation to review,
                validate or correct any User Generated Content posted by you or by any other user of the Sites
                (including pallet and tool submissions on the Marketplace sub-domain), and under no circumstances will

              <p>
                In addition, we may from time to time provide interactive services on the Sites that shall enable you to
                upload User Generated Content, including, without limitation, comment facilities, chat rooms and/or

              <p>
                Where we provide an Interactive Service, we will use reasonable endeavours to provide information to you
                about the kind of service offered and if it is moderated. However, we are under no obligation to
                oversee, monitor or moderate any Interactive Service we provide.
              </p>
              <p>
                The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or
                guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an Interactive Service that it is important
                that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Minors who are using any
                Interactive Service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Viruses</p>

                material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access
                to the Sites, the server on which the Sites are stored or any server, computer or database connected to
                the Sites. You must not attack the Sites via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of
                service attack. By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer
                Misuse Act 1990. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will
                cooperate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach,
                your right to use the Sites will cease immediately.

                Any content (including User Generated Content), communications or materials you send to us through the

                profession then, save as set out in the first paragraph under &quot;General exclusions&quot; above, the
                following provisions shall apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our total liability to you for any Losses arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether in
                contract (including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence) or otherwise shall be limited to
                £100.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights. Advice about your statutory rights is available
                from your local Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office.
              </p>
              <p>
                We only supply the Sites to you for domestic and private use. You agree not to access and use the Sites,
                or any content on the Sites, for any commercial or business purposes and we have no liability to you for
                any loss of profit, loss or corruption of data, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of
                business opportunity.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Suspension and termination</p>
              <p>
                If you breach any of these Terms, we may immediately do any or all of the following (without
                limitation): (a) issue a warning to you; (b) temporarily or permanently remove any User Generated
                Content uploaded by you to the Sites; (c) temporarily or permanently withdraw your right to use the
                Sites; (d) issue legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all costs resulting from the breach
                (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs); (e) take further legal
                action against you; and/or (f) disclose such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably
                feel is necessary to do so.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Changes to the Sites and these Terms</p>
              <p>
                We may update the Sites from time to time, and may change the content at any time. However, please note
                that any of the content on the Sites may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no
                obligation to update it.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may revise and make changes to these Terms at any time and from time to time. Please check these
                Terms regularly to ensure that you understand the Terms that apply at the time that you access and use
                the Sites.
              </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Other important information</p>
              <p>
                Each of the provisions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides
                that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and
                effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce
                our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights
                against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a
                default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive
                any later default by you.

                You may bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms to – at your discretion - either the
                competent court of England, or to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this
                country of habitual residence is an EU Member State, which courts are – with the exclusion of any other
                court - competent to settle such a dispute. We shall bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms
                to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this is in an EU Member State, or
                otherwise the competent court of England.

                resident, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are
                resident. Nothing in these Terms, including in the two paragraphs immediately above, affect your rights
                as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
