                those with whom you interact as well as other participants on those networks may be able to determine
                certain things about you through your use of those networks.

            <p>According to the GDPR, you may have the following rights pursuant to Art. 15-18 and 20-21 GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>

                GDPR); and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a
                structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller (Art.
                20 GDPR); In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in
                particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement –
                Art. 21 GDPR).

              <li>
                Where we have asked for your consent, you may withdraw consent at any time (Art. 7 par. 3 GDPR). If you

            </ul>
            <p>
              These <strong>rights may be limited</strong>, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal
              data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or
              if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate
              interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in the GDPR. We will inform you of relevant
              exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.

              processing operations. The legal basis for the joint processing and transmission of personal data between

              interests of the companies under Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR, to transmit personal data for internal
              administrative purposes, including the processing of personal data of business partners, customers and

              corresponding joint controller agreement will be made available on request.

              <strong>How long will you retain my data?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you are a business partner, contributor, customer or a registered user, we will keep your
              information for the duration of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent
              permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in
              this notice in accordance with applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we process personal data with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a
              short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that
              you have asked us not to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Laws may require us to hold certain information of yours for specific retention periods. In other cases,
              we may retain data for an appropriate period after any relationship with you ends to protect itself from
              legal claims, or to administer its business.

              We strive to maintain the highest standards of security and Parity has put in place robust technical and
              organizational measures for the protection of your data in accordance with the current, general state of
              the art technologies, especially to protect the data against loss, falsification or access by unauthorized
              third persons. However the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. So,
              whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data

                      necessary for the Sites to function properly as it is used to identify trusted web traffic. It

                      personally identifiable information. In addition, it’s a “first-party” cookie bound to Parity’s
